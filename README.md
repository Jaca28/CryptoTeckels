CryptoTeckels was made using HashLips (Canvas API, Nodejs) library to make the art generation, then we used Pinata and NFTPort (Cloud - Gateway) to upload images and metadata (JSON) to IPFS (Interplanetary file system). Afterwards, we developed a smart contract (Solidity) with the ERC-721 standard and deployed on Polygon Blockchain using ethereum.remix.org.
